# aetheron-public-backend
Aetheron Backend Template provides a high-level view of the backend structure used across the Aetheron platform. It includes routes, controller stubs, middleware flow, and overall API organization, while intentionally omitting all private logic and sensitive code. Designed for transparency, onboarding, and future expansion.
