• Solana RPC integrations  
• File generation (PDF, TXT, DOCX, HTML, MD)  
• R2 cloud storage operations  
• Error handling, rate limits, and security layers  

All operational logic, algorithms, validation rules, 
and internal service interactions have been removed.

This template exists solely for:
• Architectural overview  
• Onboarding reference  
• API surface documentation  

It does NOT include:
• Execution logic  
• Business rules  
• Proprietary or security-critical code  
• Agent generation or packaging logic  
• Payment enforcement systems  

The real implementation is private and protected.
